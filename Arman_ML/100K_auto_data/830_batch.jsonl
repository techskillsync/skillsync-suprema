I am Phat Le (or Danny), a high school student in Forest Park studying to become a Graphic Designer/Photographer. I am currently searching for a part-time job where I can apply my education and volunteering experience to a job in fast food industry. Areas of proficiency include Graphics and Photography. In these courses I have learned to see whether or not something appeals to the average eye, and to create aesthetically pleasing images and creations. I have also developed many more skills in these classes such as creativity, being flexible with work, being productive and proficient. I am able to bring knowledge to what appeals to customer with strong backgrounds to show in these courses. For communications, I am trilingual, being able to speak English, Spanish, and Vietnamese.

Accomplishments      Being offered the opportunity to create a graphic design piece for a school event, and having my artwork chosen for the visual.

Taking part in many volunteering opportunities that span from school activities to outside events.   Being chosen to take part in an IT Program at school, where I learn Graphic Design.        Volunteering       Graphic Designer     April 2015       Company Name   \uff0d   City  ,   State     Another volunteering experience that I found to be quite important with my skills and classes that I take is being a graphic designer for a Walk Event for my school. The opportunity for a graphic designer who would design a poster/flier for the Walk for Suicide event was open and I choose to create a design and submit it for the chance to be featured. My responsibilities involved creating a design that would clearly express the beliefs of the Walk for Suicide event, state information such as the event time and address, and to intrigue the eye and to create interest overall. The event was something I believed to be very important so I took my time on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver in a timely manner. My design was actually chosen and used on different social medias of the event and was an experience that I believe helped me learn more about time management, deadlines, communication of information while doing something I enjoy.          Cashier/Waiter/Greeter     March 2013       Company Name   \uff0d   City  ,   State     A volunteering experience that I took part in was a Dog Fair back in 2013, it was an opportunity for people to come into the fair and find dogs that they wanted to adopt and also a chance for dog owners to come in with their dogs and participate in Dog races, raffles, and purchase many other dog related things in support of the Dog adoption agency to care for the other dogs that had currently not been adopted yet. My first volunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, I was to record who came into the park, asking for any donations, and if they wanted to participate in the races or raffles. As the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was upgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food. I up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that would go towards donations for the dogs. I took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues. I was able to record the orders, repeat them back in a clear, understandable manner and communicated with the other volunteers. I rotated around, taking on the responsibilities of a cashier, waiter, and greeter to provide the highest service I could give.

Skills Used Business, design & sales skills   This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.\u00a0 The family had recently hired a new, young general manager.\u00a0 He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.\u00a0       06/1991   to   09/1994     Owner/Manager      Company Name   \u2013   City  ,   State    Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.
