In addition the iCon3 tool will interface to HBS's other business systems such as purchasing and project management.  The vision of the iCon3 tool is to focus on reducing labor hours required to design, estimate, engineer, commission and service a building automation system.  Labor hours are reduced by applying automation on various levels of the object model, which reduces the overall complexity especially in the project estimation, engineering and commissioning phases.  The vision of the iCon3 tool is to focus on system configuration and minimize the need to engineer control applications.  This will be accomplished by providing various configurable models, which covers almost any kind of application.  The final goal of the iCon3 tool is to analyze the drawings provided during the estimation phase.  The tool will suggest solutions, provide optimized cost calculation and generate bid specification.  During the engineering phase, the solutions can be reused and configured according to customer specification.  Only off-standard solutions will require engineering labor.  During the commissioning phase, new innovative technology, based on the Tridium AX platform, will reduce labor and travel costs.
