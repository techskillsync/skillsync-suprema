OsteoStrong® is a unique place where you can go to improve your overall health by focusing on the one thing we all have in common: a skeletal system.The skeletal system is the foundation for your body and provides more than just strength and protection. It is arguably one of the most critical systems of the human body, and by implementing a strategy to care for and strengthen it, many experience the following results:
• Improved bone density• Improved posture• Improved balance• Improved athletic performance• Less joint and back pain
OsteoStrong® works for people at all ages and levels of activity to promote skeletal strength which impacts the entire body in many ways using a process known as Osteogenic Loading.

Join our fun team at OsteoStrong as a coach! We are specifically focused on building bone density, fracture prevention, and strength and balance improvement.

We're open Monday through Thursday and do not expect 40 hours from you.
Responsibilities:Instruct/coach members daily on our four osteogenic loading devices. The osteogenic loading devices help members effectively load their own skeletal system safely.

"EXECUTIVE PERSONAL ASSISTANT
In this role, you’re the right hand superperson to the Founder and your contribution to their life and business allows them to run their company more effectively and have a bigger impact in the world while finding time to still prioritize their family and personal life. 
At Business of Therapy, we believe that people receive the best care when their therapists are able to live their best lives, with the confidence to show up authentically, free from financial stress and burnout. Business of Therapy offers a wide-range of services to support therapists in starting and growing their own private practices. Current programs include: free webinars and educational content, a membership, self-paced course, business coaching, brand partnerships, and speaking engagement.

The Executive Personal Assistant will assist both the Founder and Operations Manager with administrative tasks to help the business run smoothly and efficiently. This is a great flexible work from home opportunity. 
THIS JOB DONE WELL LOOKS LIKE: 
Taking initiative and anticipating needs before they’re even communicated. 
Never sitting on your hands with a low workload. Recognizing that delegating takes time and effort, so making a conscious effort to seek out tasks and manage your own workload. 
Making sure that things never need to be repeated, i.e. if you’re sent a task, make sure that the work you did is documented, so that if you’re asked to do a task again you will know what will need to be repeated, documented, and assigned. 
Effective and efficient communication: instead of multiple texts, emails, calls and messages throughout the day, questions and updates will be combined (along with all relevant information) for the Founder or Operations Manager to reply to in an easy format. Respecting time and day boundaries, making sure that you ask questions well ahead of time, not leaving things last minute. 
Requiring zero follow-up from the Founder or Operations Manager - if you’re asked to do a task and you know it’s going to take longer than a day or two, make sure the task is added into your task management system and regular updates are given so the team knows that you’re on top of it and doesn’t need to ask.
Having a strong attention to detail, so that the Operations Manager and Founder don’t need to provide Quality Assurance or ask for more information.
Overall, making the Founder's day, weeks and months easier because you’re on top of yours and their workload, you communicate effectively, you don’t add extra tasks to their plate and you are continuously seeking out learning opportunities so you can continue to expand your job role, responsibilities and knowledge. 
JOB DESCRIPTIONThis role requires support in three different areas: administrative, executive, and personal. This position will report to both the Operations Manager, for administrative tasks and the Founder, for executive and personal support.

"TIBN is designed as a network of networks, meaning that we don't seek to replace any existing network, simply to provide access to resources which might be beyond the scope of existing networks. The additional scope we provide falls into 3 categories:
Impact focused - While we do provide professional and personal development resources, they are all framed in terms of helping members maximize their positive Impact on the world, not simply business/career success or general happinessGlobally oriented - Spirit of the Game is one of the fastest growing NGOs in the world right now, adding 50-100 volunteer each week, meaning that when you join our network, you gain access to other members and experts all over the world, not just a handful of countriesEmpowerment centric- We don't want our members simply to be students, we also want to empower them to take the skills and mindsets they learn from our experts and pass them on to others
We are looking for City Chairpersons for TIBN United States to join our 10 week Management Training course which will give you step by step directions on getting an Impactful Business community started in your city, complete with training manuals, peer support calls, and a Mentor.
Promotions to our National team will also become available after your first month of training, where you can support our National Chairperson in one or more of the following areas:PartnershipsMember EventsRetreats and ConferencesSocial MediaMember Onboarding
While SpiritoftheGame.org is 4 years old, each of our divisions operate autonomously, so TIBN is essentially start-up which doesn't wish to be beholden to investors who might change their priorities if the economy goes south.So we do need to bring in the revenue before we can start paying you. And since we cannot promise how quickly that will happen, it's best to approach this as a pure volunteer opportunity which ""should"" pay a stipend in the near future or possibly a salary in the long term.If you do not currently have another source of income and/or you are looking to get paid straight away, this is not the position for you.
Estimated time commitment we are looking for while this is a volunteer position is 8-12 hours a week. You will also have considerable discretion if you wish to bring in additional people from your existing professional network for any of our open City Chairpersons positions in other cities or for City Director roles on your own team.
TIBN is a part of the World Spirit of the Game Foundation, an international NGO which was formed to help individuals and organizations take Personal Accountability for maximizing their positive Impact on the world.We're launching the TIBN online community with 4-6 online events each month this winter, and are now starting in-person chapters and Retreats as well.
