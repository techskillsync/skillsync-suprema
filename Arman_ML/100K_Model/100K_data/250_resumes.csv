I am Phat Le (or Danny), a high school student in Forest Park studying to become a Graphic Designer/Photographer. I am currently searching for a part-time job where I can apply my education and volunteering experience to a job in fast food industry. Areas of proficiency include Graphics and Photography. In these courses I have learned to see whether or not something appeals to the average eye, and to create aesthetically pleasing images and creations. I have also developed many more skills in these classes such as creativity, being flexible with work, being productive and proficient. I am able to bring knowledge to what appeals to customer with strong backgrounds to show in these courses. For communications, I am trilingual, being able to speak English, Spanish, and Vietnamese. I also able to communicate with others to exchange any ideas and solutions and have volunteer experience that involves many different types of interaction with customers and co-volunteers.

I am currently in my 3rd year in Spanish Classes, and I was given the opportunity to join the Spanish Honor Society at my school recently. And I can also speak Vietnamese on a fluent level, but I am not able to write in Vietnamese.        Accomplishments      Being offered the opportunity to create a graphic design piece for a school event, and having my artwork chosen for the visual.  Meeting consistent deadlines with my work in all my classes, including Graphic Design which involves projects every week or so, and being creative to create an original idea to be graded and possibly featured in art shows in the city.  Taking part in many volunteering opportunities that span from school activities to outside events.   Being chosen to take part in an IT Program at school, where I learn Graphic Design.        Volunteering       Graphic Designer     April 2015       Company Name   －   City  ,   State     Another volunteering experience that I found to be quite important with my skills and classes that I take is being a graphic designer for a Walk Event for my school. The opportunity for a graphic designer who would design a poster/flier for the Walk for Suicide event was open and I choose to create a design and submit it for the chance to be featured. My responsibilities involved creating a design that would clearly express the beliefs of the Walk for Suicide event, state information such as the event time and address, and to intrigue the eye and to create interest overall. The event was something I believed to be very important so I took my time on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver in a timely manner. My design was actually chosen and used on different social medias of the event and was an experience that I believe helped me learn more about time management, deadlines, communication of information while doing something I enjoy.          Cashier/Waiter/Greeter     March 2013       Company Name   －   City  ,   State     A volunteering experience that I took part in was a Dog Fair back in 2013, it was an opportunity for people to come into the fair and find dogs that they wanted to adopt and also a chance for dog owners to come in with their dogs and participate in Dog races, raffles, and purchase many other dog related things in support of the Dog adoption agency to care for the other dogs that had currently not been adopted yet. My first volunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, I was to record who came into the park, asking for any donations, and if they wanted to participate in the races or raffles. As the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was upgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food. I up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that would go towards donations for the dogs. I took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues. I was able to record the orders, repeat them back in a clear, understandable manner and communicated with the other volunteers. I rotated around, taking on the responsibilities of a cashier, waiter, and greeter to provide the highest service I could give.

Assisted clients with budget considerations regarding products and materials.  Skills Used Business, design & sales skills   This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.  The family had recently hired a new, young general manager.  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.        06/1991   to   09/1994     Owner/Manager      Company Name   –   City  ,   State    Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.

Building was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease.  I had moved the business once and paid for build-out of this space.  I couldn't afford to move again; decided to close business instead.        Current     Principal      Company Name   –   City  ,   State      Consulted with clients to determine architectural preference to meet overall design goals.

Prepared construction documents and details to implement design concepts.   Established at the time of graduation from design school, I began my independent career, on a full-time basis.  When business was slow (due to recession, etc.) I accepted employment with well established firms.  I have continued to serve many repeat clients and referrals over the years.       Transitional Vocation    In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.  I was owner of income properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.  Within six months, all units were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.    In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment complex.  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I heard while marketing existing floor plans.  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a long waiting list.  Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely gratifying.  I continued in this position to the end of construction.  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a Residential Property Management Certificate.  My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design.        Education     1970     Associate of Arts  :   architectural/interior design     New York School of Interior Design   -   City  ,   State      Architecture and interior design history   Fine arts history   Color theory and application   Light theory and application   Textiles  Upholstery  Window treatments  Paint, surface textures, wallcoverings  Interior building materials  Architectural drawing and perspective rendering  Business and marketing principles for designers    All courses were taught by professionals in their respective fields with years of practical experience.         1967     Associate of Arts  :   business principles and skills     Lansing Business University (Davenport Business College)   -   City  ,   State      Basic business management principles  Business law  Office management    Accounting/bookkeeping  Office skills (typing, shorthand, business machines, etc.)  Business etiquette           Skills    Accounting, advertising, Basic, business law, business writing, computer aided design, Color, com, client, clients, drafting, Edit, email, Interior Design, marketing, Materials, window, rendering, retail, sales skills, sales, shorthand, space-planning, specification, phone, typing   ",DESIGNER
